When adding a strings.xml for a new language, you need to follow this convention (from official android website):

The language is defined by a two-letter ISO 639-1 language code, optionally followed by a two letter ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 region code (preceded by lowercase "r").

You can find ISO 639-1 Codes here:
